This starter template comes pre-loaded with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), a utility CSS framework that allows you to customize and build complex designs without touching a line of CSS. There are also a few base CSS files in the `/source/_assets/css` folder, set up with the expectation that you can add any custom CSS into `_blog.css`.

```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@import './base.css' layer(components);
@import './blog.css' layer(components);
```
